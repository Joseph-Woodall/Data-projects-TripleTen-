| Review Frequency as a Proxy for Attractiveness:<br><br>The number of reviews in the last 12 months (number_of_reviews_ltm) is assumed to be a reliable proxy for how often a property is rented. <br>This is based on the understanding that reviews are typically left after a stay, indicating rental frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Neighborhood and Property Size Preferences:<br><br>It is assumed that the most popular property size in each neighborhood is indicative of market demand. <br>For example, 1-bedroom listings are assumed to be the most attractive in all top neighborhoods except Midtown, where studios are preferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Revenue Calculation:<br><br>The revenue for each listing is calculated by summing the adjusted_price for days when the property is rented (indicated by available being "f"). <br>This assumes that the adjusted price accurately reflects the revenue earned per night.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Annual Revenue Estimation:<br><br>The annual revenue is estimated by multiplying the 30-day revenue by 12. <br>This assumes consistent booking rates and pricing throughout the year, without accounting for seasonal variations or potential changes in demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Data Completeness and Accuracy:<br><br>The dataset is assumed to be complete and accurate, representing the Manhattan vacation rental market effectively. <br>Any missing or erroneous data could impact the analysis results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Currency and Pricing:<br><br>All prices are assumed to be in USD, and no currency conversion is necessary for the analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
